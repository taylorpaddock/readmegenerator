# readmegenerator

## Description

Create a README generator using node.js so anyone can quickly create a professional README for any project.

## Installation

In Visual Studio Code or a similar application open your integrated terminal tied to the index.js of this project and run 'npm install'. This will download all packages needed to run the application.

## Usage

Type in 'node index.js' to run the application. This is the best way to cut down time spent formating a README file. See the below gif to see how the application should run.

## How to Contribute

Update formating to look cleaner. <br>
Link to a website application, so this can all function online and not on your computer terminal.
